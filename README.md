# Home Media Server
(Python2)

A media home server to stream video from your laptop to any device on the same Wi-Fi
(can be broadcasted to the Internet as well)!

Learned from multiple resources on the Internet - can't remember them all.
To use, place all your videos in 'static/video', then run
`python media_server.py`.

Currently, this lacks a good front-end design. I will add them when I get time.
In the meantime, pull requests are welcome!
